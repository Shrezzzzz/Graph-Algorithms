Graph algorithms are crucial for solving real-world problems involving networks and relationships. 
Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores nodes level by level, while Depth-First Search (DFS) traverses deeper paths first. 
Topological Sort orders vertices in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), useful in task scheduling. 
Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms construct Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) efficiently. 
Dijkstra’s Algorithm finds the shortest path from a source to all vertices in a graph with non-negative weights, while Bellman-Ford Algorithm handles graphs with negative weights. 
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm computes all-pairs shortest paths using dynamic programming.
